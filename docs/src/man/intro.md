# Basics

The following few sections should help you on your way to setting up and running simulations.

## TensorKit

MPSKit works on "TensorMap" objects defined in TensorKit.jl. These abstract objects can represent not only plain arrays but also symmetric tensors. A TensorMap is a linear map from its domain to its codomain.

Initializing a TensorMap can be done using
```julia
TensorMap(initializer,eltype,codomain,domain);
TensorMap(inputdat,codomain,domain);
```

As an example, the following creates a random map from ℂ^10 to ℂ^10 (which is equivalent to a random matrix)
```julia
TensorMap(rand,ComplexF64,ℂ^10,ℂ^10);
dat = rand(ComplexF64,10,10); TensorMap(dat,ℂ^10,ℂ^10);
```
Similarly, the following creates a symmetric tensor
```julia
TensorMap(rand,ComplexF64,Rep[U₁](0=>1)*Rep[U₁](1//2=>3),Rep[U₁](1//2=>1,-1//2=>2))
```

TensorKit defines a number of operations on TensorMap objects
```julia
a = TensorMap(rand,ComplexF64,ℂ^10,ℂ^10);
3*a; a+a; a*a; a*adjoint(a); a-a; dot(a,a); norm(a);
```

but the primary workhorse is the @tensor macro
```julia
a = TensorMap(rand,ComplexF64,ℂ^10,ℂ^10);
b = TensorMap(rand,ComplexF64,ℂ^10,ℂ^10);
@tensor c[-1;-2]:=a[-1,1]*b[1,-2];
```
creates a new TensorMap c equal to a*b.

## Overview

Within MPSKit we defined a set of [states](@ref um_states), a number of [operators](@ref um_operators) and some [algorithms](@ref um_algorithms) which combine the two in a nontrivial way.

As a simple example we can define a FiniteMPS
```julia
state = FiniteMPS(rand,ComplexF64,10,ℂ^2,ℂ^10);
```

A hamiltonian operator
```julia
opp = nonsym_ising_ham();
```

And use this to find the groundstate
```julia
(groundstate,_) = find_groundstate(state,opp,DMRG());
```

## Tips & tricks

- There is an examples folder
- Julia inference is taxed a lot; so use (jupyter notebooks / Revise ) instead of re-running a script everytime
